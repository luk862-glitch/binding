        <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">Designers and critics alike reject style as shallow and meaningless. But they overlook the complex ways in which its codes are used by different social groups.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>A surprising consensus about style is emerging within contemporary graphic design. Its proponents include cultural critics eager to expose consumerist trickery, conservative critics who lambast entire genres for being mere followers of fashion, and progressive critics who bemoan the popular dilution of innovative graphics. Although the agendas and targets are different, these factions share a distrust of style as false, shallow and meaningless.</p>
        <p>The proliferation of design since the 1980s has been blamed for transforming graphic design from a problem-solving process into a style-conscious cog in the fashion system. Recent work has been dismissed as <em>empty formalism</em> whose excesses mask a poverty of content.</p>
        <p>Such opinions often rest on a rejection of the work’s aesthetics, or on a misfit between the aesthetic preferences of the critic and the values embodied in the work.</p>
        <p>The idea that style is meaningless goes back to Modern functionalism. The Modernist notion of deceptive forms (style) on the surface and essential contents (substance) at the core is outmoded for contemporary graphic design, which must respond to fragmented audiences. Dismissals of style ignore the complex ways in which it circulates as a communicative code.</p>

        <section>
        <h2>Form vs. Content</h2>
        <p>Debates about style usually invoke dualisms such as form/content and style/substance. These artificial dichotomies divorce the terms from one another, giving the mistaken impression that form exists independent of content. Since each term is married to the other, a relationship must be negotiated.</p>
        <p>Form is legitimised on the basis of content; the problem (content) is inseparable from the solution (form). As Alvin Lustig wrote:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">“We will simply solve each problem within its own terms, without conscious thought concerning ‘styles,’ modern or traditional.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The twentieth century has been characterised by a rejection of form that is empty or extraneous. Often such form is dismissed as mere style. Style has also been criticised as an appeal to popular tastes. The issues of style and taste are ignored in most theoretical accounts of Modern design.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h2>Functionalism’s Transparent Ideal</h2>
        <p>The dismissal of style does not do away with aesthetics. Proper visual solutions require faithful representation of content. This thinking informs maxims such as Sullivan’s <em>form follows function</em> and the Bauhaus insistence on “truth in materials.”</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">“What we perceive as form, and therefore as beauty, is the natural, self-evident, and functional appearance.”<span class="name">—Max Bill</span></p>
        </blockquote>
        <p class="quote">The Modernist equation denies the subjectivity of aesthetic judgment and the designer’s expression. Josef Müller-Brockmann argues for an objective form language:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">“The more anonymous and objective these elements are the more suitable they prove as a vehicle for the thematic idea.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Form expresses not the designer’s subjectivity but the content of a conceptual solution. Yet pleasurable forms of style also communicate taste and social status.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h2>Modern Definitions in a Post-Modern Context</h2>
        <p>The definitions of style, form and content used today were cast in the Modern era. Their application to a post-industrial, late-capitalist context is problematic. Although the context has changed, the definitions persist.</p>
        <p>The purity of the problem-solution equation leaves no room for form not attributable to internal content, for taste as an aesthetic value, or for designers who add their own statements.</p>
        <p>Though style is banished to the hinterlands of non-meaning, it is still found in the work of designers who reach outward to the masses.</p>
        </section>

        <h2>The Seductive Surface</h2>
        <p>While functionalism evaded style, contemporary critics tend to see design as nothing but style.</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">“Style, more and more, has become the official idiom of the marketplace.” — Stuart Ewen</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Here, style deludes as it seduces: its surface diverts us from the truth.</p>
        <p>Designers echo this sentiment. Jon Wozencroft criticises British “style culture” for masking difficult material under a “gloss finish.”</p>
        <p>Conservative critics likewise dismiss fashionable work as aberrant form, replacing problem-solving with style.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h2>Parody and Pastiche</h2>
        <p>Style is not governed by functionalist truth. It engages us on the surface, as appearance, where it gains meaning through difference.</p>
        <p>Parody imitates stylistic features while undercutting their foundation. Spy magazine’s parody of J.Crew replaces upper-middle-class imagery with inner-city streetwear, using careful stylistic duplication to carry its humour.</p>
        <p>Parody may target a genre, as in John Bielenberg’s “Virtual Telemetrix,” which mimics corporate design to comment on design culture.</p>
        <p>Pastiche is a style hodge-podge lacking parody’s humour. Wired magazine’s layered spreads exemplify this “digital style.”</p>
        <p>Professional mimicry of vernacular forms—flyers, circulars, clip-art—is another form of pastiche.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h2>A Multitude of Dialects</h2>
        <p>The demise of Modern functionalism has allowed for a proliferation of styles. Graphic design today is a collection of private languages—a multitude of dialects—rather than unified movements.</p>
        <p>Style operates as a code of communication, signifying taste as much as content. It must be recognisable and categorisable, communicating with specific social groups.</p>
        <p>Youth culture graphics show style’s ability to represent loosely defined interests. Ray Gun exemplifies this, its code embraced by readers and rejected by outsiders.</p>
        <p>Designers also refine vernacular styles, as with Burton snowboards. Youth style has even been used to sell political awareness, as in Say for Amnesty International.</p>
        <p>Style does not hold meaning within itself; it is a cultural code operating in shifting networks. Styles are exchanged—bought, borrowed or stolen.</p>
        <p>The co-optability of a style stems from its capacity to carry surplus meaning. Styles can convey seriousness, authority or camp sensibility depending on context.</p>
        <p>Style also communicates mainstream taste, as in Martha Stewart Living, whose design embodies aspirational elegance.</p>
        <p>Designers themselves are targeted through style-based advertising, such as Absolut’s designer-coded bottle ads.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <h2>Codes of Communication</h2>
        <p>Old debates based on aesthetic judgments must give way to discussions based on the aesthetic values of designers, critics and consumers. There is no privileged hierarchy; only competing beliefs.</p>
        <p>To understand design’s social status, we must consider how it is perceived by audiences who navigate many styles daily. Style carries information about societal communication codes.</p>
        <p>New technologies expand design’s availability and hasten the dispersal of styles. This places renewed attention on graphic design’s materiality—its expression on the very surface we try to dismiss.</p>
