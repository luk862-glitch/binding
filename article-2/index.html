        <!-- <h2>The Persistence of the Style–Content Divide</h2> -->
        <p>It would hard to find any reputable literary critic today who would care to be caught defending as an idea the old antithesis of <em>style versus content</em>. On this issue a pious consensus prevails. Everyone is quick to avow that style and content are indissoluble, that</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">Strongly individual style of each important writer is an organic aspect of his work and never something merely “decorative.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>In the practice of criticism, though, the old antithesis lives on, virtually unassailed. <em>Most of the same critics who disclaim, in passing, the notion that style is an accessory to content maintain the duality whenever they apply themselves to particular works of literature.</em> It is not so easy, after all, to get unstuck from a distinction that practically holds together the fabric of critical discourse, and serves to perpetuate certain intellectual aims and vested interests which themselves remain unchallenged and would be difficult to surrender without a fully articulated working replacement at hand.</p>
        <p>In fact, to talk about the style of a particular novel or poem at all as a “style,” without implying, whether one wishes to or not, that style is merely decorative, accessory, is extremely hard. Merely by employing the notion, one is almost bound to invoke, albeit implicitly, an antithesis between style and something else. Many critics appear not to realize this. <em>They think themselves sufficiently protected by a theoretical disclaimer on the vulgar filtering-off of style from content, all the while their judgments continue to reinforce precisely what they are, in theory, eager to deny.</em></p>

        <!-- <h2>The Notion of a Style-less Art</h2> -->
        <p>One way in which the old duality lives on in the practice of criticism, in concrete judgments, is the frequency with which quite admirable works of art are defended as good although what is miscalled their style is acknowledged to be crude or careless. Another is the frequency with which a very complex style is regarded with a barely concealed ambivalence. Contemporary writers and other artists with a style that is intricate, hermetic, demanding-not to speak of “beautiful”—get their ration of unstinting praise. Still, it is clear that such a style is often felt to be a form of insincerity: evidence of the artist’s intrusion upon his materials, which should be allowed to deliver themselves in a pure state.</p>
        <p><a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Whitman">Whitman</a>, in the preface to the 1855 edition of Leaves of Grass, expresses the disavowal of “style” which is, in most arts since the last century, a standard ploy for ushering in a new stylistic vocabulary. “The greatest poet has less a marked style and is more the free channel of himself,” that great and very mannered poet contends. “He says to his art, I will not be meddlesome I will not have in my writing any elegance or effect or originality to hang in the way between me and the rest like curtains. I will have nothing hang in the my, not the richest curtains. What I tell I tell for precisely what it is.”</p>
        <p>Of course, as everyone knows or claims to know, <em>there is no neutral, absolutely transparent style.</em> Sartre has shown, in his excellent review of The Stranger, how the celebrated “white style” of Camus’ novel-impersonal, expository, lucid, flat—is itself the vehicle of Meursault’s image of the world (as made up of absurd, fortuitous moments) . What Roland Barthes calls “the zero degree of writing” is, precisely by being anti-metaphorical and dehumanized, as selective and artificial as any traditional style of writing.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the notion of a style-less, transparent art is one of the most tenacious fantasies of modem culture. Artists and critics pretend to believe that it is no more possible to get the artifice out of art than it is for a person to lose his personality. <em>Yet the aspiration lingers—a permanent dissent from modem art, with its dizzying velocity of style changes</em>.</p>

        <!-- <h2>Misleading Metaphors</h2> -->
        <p>To speak of style is one way of speaking about the totality of a work of art. Like all discourse about totalities, talk of style must rely on metaphors. And metaphors mislead.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, Whitman’s very material metaphor. By likening style to a curtain, he has of course confused style with decoration and for this would be speedily faulted by most critics. To conceive of style as a decorative encumbrance on the matter of the work suggests that the curtain could be parted and the matter revealed; or, to vary the metaphor slightly, that the curtain could be rendered transparent. But this is not the only erroneous implication of the metaphor. What the metaphor also suggests is that style is a matter of more or less (quantity), thick or thin (density) . And, though less obviously so, this is just as wrong as the fancy that an artist possesses the genuine option to have or not to have a style. <em>Style is not quantitative</em>, any more than it is superadded. A more complex stylistic convention-say, one taking prose further away from the diction and cadences of ordinary speech—does not mean that the work has “more” style.</p>
        <p>Indeed, practically all metaphors for style amount to placing matter on the inside, style on the outside. It would be more to the point to reverse the metaphor. <em>The matter, the subject, is on the outside; the style is on the Inside.</em> As <a class=link href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Cocteau>Cocteau</a> writes:</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">“Decorative style has never existed. Style is the soul, and unfortunately with us the soul assumes the form of the body.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Even if one were to define style as the manner of our appearing, this by no means necessarily entails an opposition between a style that one assumes and one’s “true” being. In fact, such a disjunction is extremely rare. In almost every case, our manner of appearing is our manner of being. The mask is the face.</p>
        <p>I should make clear, however, that what I have been saying about dangerous metaphors doesn’t rule out the use of limited and concrete metaphors to describe the impact of a particular style. It seems harmless to speak of a style, drawing from the crude terminology used to render physical sensations, as being “loud” or “heavy” or “full” or “tasteless” or, employing the image of an argument as “inconsistent.”</p>

        <!-- <h2>Style as Historical Awareness</h2> -->
        <p>The antipathy to “style” is always an antipathy to a given style. <em>There are no style-less works of art, only works of art belonging to different, more or less complex stylistic traditions and conventions.</em></p>
        <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">This means that the notion of style, generically considered, has a specific, historical meaning.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>It is not only that styles belong to a time and a place; and that our perception of the style of a given work of art is always charged with an awareness of the work’s historicity, its place in a chronology. <em>Further: the visibility of styles is itself a product of historical consciousness.</em> Were it not for departures from, or experimentation with, previous artistic norms which are known to us, we could never recognize the profile of a new style. <em>Still further: the very notion of “style” needs to be approached historically.</em> Awareness of style as a problematic and isolable element in a work of art has emerged in the audience for art only at certain historical moments—as a front behind which other issues, ultimately ethical and political, are being debated. The notion of “having a style” is one of the solutions that has arisen, intermittently since the Renaissance, to the crises that have threatened old ideas of truth, of moral rectitude, and also of naturalness.</p>

        <!-- <h2>Art as Experience</h2> -->
        <p>To treat works of art in this fashion is not wholly irrelevant. But it is, obviously, putting art to use—for such purposes as inquiring into the history of ideas, diagnosing contemporary culture, or creating social solidarity. Such a treatment has little to do with what actually happens when a person possessing some training and aesthetic sensibility looks at a work of art appropriately. A work of art encountered as</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">A work of art encountered as a work of art is an experience, not a statement or an answer to a question. </p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Art is not only about something; it is something. A work of art is a thing in the world, not just a text or commentary on the world.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
        <!-- <h2>Style as Decision</h2> -->
        <p>The hyperdevelopment of style in, for example, Mannerist painting and Art Nouveau, is an emphatic form of experiencing the world as an aesthetic phenomenon. But only a particularly emphatic form, which arises in reaction to an oppressively dogmatic style of realism. All style—that is, all art-proclaims this. And <em>the world is, ultimately, an aesthetic phenomenon.</em></p>
        <p>The work of art, so far as we give ourselves to it, exercises a total or absolute claim on us. The purpose of art is not as an auxiliary to truth, either particular and historical or eternal. “If art is anything,” as Robbe-Grillet has written, “it is everything; in which case it must be self-sufficient, and there can be nothing beyond it.”</p>
        <blockquote>
        <p class="quote">Style is the principle of decision in a work of art, the signature of the artist’s will.</p>
        </blockquote>
